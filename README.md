 Programs and applications made at the Algorithm Uni. classes

✔️(1º challenge) FILE: BST - Basic Binary Search Tree implementation, the user just inputs the value, through the main, to the program. It was the first implementation challenge, so it was easy.

✔️(2º challenge) FILE: BST_implementation - In this challenge, the program reads data from an archive and organize the students by grade into a BST. This challange was more complex than the first one, because it involves file reading and a better functions organization. It is fully organized on a way that is easy for the user to figure out what to do.
